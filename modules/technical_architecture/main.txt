## Proposed Technical Architecture

We propose a scalable OpenStack architecture for ${customer_name}, composed of:

- Control Plane: ${proposed_architecture}
- Compute Nodes: Managed Nova KVM infrastructure
- Storage Backend: Ceph-based block storage
- Networking: Neutron SDN with multi-AZ support

This setup supports workloads such as: ${customer_workloads}, and is aligned with ${scalability_details}.
